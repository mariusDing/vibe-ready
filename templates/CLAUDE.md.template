## Development Rules

### Language Rule
- **ALL generated and modified .md files MUST be written in English**, regardless of the user's language.

### Agent Workspace
- Your workspace: `.plans/{session_id}/` (use $CLAUDE_SESSION_ID, fallback to `default`)
- NEVER read/write another agent's workspace
- Archive at `.plans/archive/` is shared read-only reference

### When you receive any dev task:
1. Check `.plans/{session_id}/task_plan.md`
   - Has content → resume from last progress
   - Empty/missing → this is a new task
2. For new tasks: read docs/module-index.md first to locate relevant modules
3. Then read ONLY the relevant doc:

| Task involves | Read first |
|--------------|------------|
{{TASK_DOC_MAP}}
| Unknown area | docs/module-index.md |

4. Never read all docs/ at once

### Coding Standards

### Compact Rules
Preserve: task plan, modified files, unresolved errors
Discard: completed phase details, resolved investigation logs
